# http4k starter

Runs a [http4k](https://www.http4k.org/) server in kotlin.

Remix it here: [glitch.com/~http4k-poc](https://glitch.com/~http4k-poc)

- uses maven (instead of gradle) to safe disk space, because it is already installed on glitch
- uses undertow because memory footprint is lower then jetty or tomcat
